 Unity Assignment for GIMM 290

The changes that I made to the game are that I added a score system that turns the game basically into tag.
I started with a simple system that tracks when someone jumps over the other player and adds a point to the score.
I then switched it to be tag because I thought that would be more interesting, this makes it so the player that isn't it isn't able to score while they aren't it, therefore creating restriction. 
So they have to just run away and try not to be tagged by the other player. This makes the space in the level more meaningful in my opinion because it gives that player room to run away. 
I also want to add an element in the world called the "No tagbacks button" that lets the player that isn't it call no tagbacks and therefore win the game.
I didn't have time to do that this week but I plan to add that as we keep working on this project. 


Unity 6 Assignment

This week I addressed some logic issues that were plaguing my build from last week. I had already built a scoring system, but it was made to only track which player was it, and it no longer kept track of a score. I changed it so it will still track who is it, but now it will also keep track of each players score which is really just how many times they have successfully tagged the other player. Who is it is displayed in the top middle of the screen, and each players score is tracked in the top left and right corners.
