# Leap Frog Parkour Masters
 Unity Assignment for GIMM 290

The changes that I made to the game are that I added a score system that turns the game basically into tag.
I started with a simple system that tracks when someone jumps over the other player and adds a point to the score.
I then switched it to be tag because I thought that would be more interesting, this makes it so the player that isn't it isn't able to score while they aren't it, therefore creating restriction. 
So they have to just run away and try not to be tagged by the other player. This makes the space in the level more meaningful in my opinion because it gives that player room to run away. 
I also want to add an element in the world called the "No tagbacks button" that lets the player that isn't it call no tagbacks and therefore win the game.
I didn't have time to do that this week but I plan to add that as we keep working on this project.
